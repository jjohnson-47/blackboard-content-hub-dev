# Event Bus Architecture Decision Record

## Context

DevPreview UI requires a communication mechanism that allows components to interact without direct dependencies. Given the nature of our application, which integrates various math visualization tools and manages complex state across components, we need an architecture that:

1. Enables loose coupling between components
2. Supports asynchronous communication
3. Works well with our dependency injection system
4. Scales to support complex component interaction patterns
5. Supports communication both within the application and across iframe boundaries

## Decision

We will implement a centralized event bus system following the publish-subscribe pattern. The implementation will:

1. Provide a simple interface for components to subscribe to and publish events
2. Support multiple subscribers for any given event
3. Handle subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks
4. Support one-time event subscriptions
5. Include error isolation to prevent event listener failures from cascading

## Design

The event system consists of:

- **IEventBus Interface**: A contract defining the core event system capabilities
- **EventBus Implementation**: A concrete implementation of the event bus
- **Event Naming Conventions**: Standardized patterns for event names
- **Event Payload Structures**: Conventions for payload format and content

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct Component References**: Components could hold direct references to one another and call methods directly. This approach was rejected because it creates tight coupling, making components harder to test and replace.

2. **State Management Library (Redux, MobX)**: A full state management solution could provide similar capabilities. This approach was rejected as overly complex for our current needs, potentially introducing unnecessary dependencies and conceptual overhead.

3. **DOM-Based Event System**: Using the browser's native event system. Rejected as it would limit our architecture to browser environments and doesn't align well with our dependency injection approach.

4. **Reactive Streams (RxJS)**: A more powerful but complex event system. Rejected as introducing unnecessary complexity for our current requirements, though we may revisit this decision if more complex event handling patterns emerge.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Components can be developed and tested in isolation
- New components can be added without modifying existing ones
- Event-based integration testing becomes more straightforward
- System is flexible enough to evolve as requirements change
- Implementation is lightweight and doesn't introduce external dependencies

### Negative

- Event-based debugging can be more challenging than direct method calls
- Risk of "event spaghetti" if naming conventions are not followed
- No compile-time type checking for event names or payloads without additional tooling

## Usage Guidelines

- Events should be named using domain:action pattern (e.g., `editor:content-changed`)
- Prefer more specific events over generic ones for clarity
- Event payloads should be self-contained and include all necessary context
- Components should unsubscribe from events when they are disposed
- Events should be published through the DI container to ensure a single instance

## Implementation Plan

1. Define the `IEventBus` interface with core methods
2. Implement a concrete `EventBus` class
3. Register the event bus in the service container
4. Develop patterns for components to use the event bus
5. Document standard events in a central location

## Status

Accepted and implemented
