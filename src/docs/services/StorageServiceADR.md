# Architecture Decision Record: Storage Service Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The DevPreview UI needs a persistent storage mechanism to save and retrieve component data (HTML, CSS, JS) and metadata. This functionality is critical for enabling users to create, save, and manage their components across sessions. 

Key requirements:
- Store component metadata separately from content
- Support both local and remote storage
- Provide a consistent interface regardless of storage backend
- Integrate with the error handling system
- Maintain performance with potentially large component data
- Enable component listing/browsing without loading full content

## Decision Drivers

- **Flexibility**: The system should support different storage backends (localStorage, IndexedDB, server)
- **Performance**: Component listing should be efficient even with many components
- **Usability**: Error handling should provide clear feedback to users
- **Maintainability**: The design should follow the project's architectural patterns
- **Testability**: Storage operations should be easily testable in isolation

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Single-Class Direct Storage Implementation

A single class that directly interfaces with localStorage/IndexedDB with no abstraction layer.

### Option 2: Adapter Pattern with Separated Interfaces

Using the adapter pattern with clear separation between the storage adapter (how data is stored) and storage service (what data is stored and when).

### Option 3: Repository Pattern with Domain Models

A more complex repository pattern with full domain models and specialized repositories for each entity type.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: Option 2 - Adapter Pattern with Separated Interfaces**

This option provides a good balance of flexibility and simplicity. It allows us to:
- Swap storage backends without changing the application logic
- Maintain a consistent interface for the rest of the application
- Clearly separate concerns between low-level storage and component-specific logic
- Test with mock storage adapters

The adapter pattern fits well with the project's dependency injection approach and supports the co-located interfaces architecture.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new storage backends (IndexedDB, remote storage)
- **Testability**: Simple to mock the storage adapter for testing
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundary between how data is stored and what is stored
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management across different storage mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Clean interfaces that are easy to document and understand

### Negative

- **Indirection**: Additional abstraction layer compared to direct storage access
- **Complexity**: Slightly more complex than a direct implementation
- **Serialization**: Need to handle JSON serialization/deserialization explicitly

## Implementation Details

### Storage Keys Schema

To maintain organization and prevent collisions, we'll use a consistent naming convention:

- Component list: `devpreview_components`
- Component data: `devpreview_component_<id>`
- Last edited component: `devpreview_last_edited`

### Error Handling

Storage errors will be categorized as `ErrorType.STORAGE` and will include:
- Quota exceeded errors
- Parsing errors for corrupted data
- Missing component errors

### Dependency Injection

The StorageService will depend on:
- `IStorageAdapter`: For the actual storage mechanism
- `IErrorHandler`: For error handling and reporting

These dependencies will be injected through the constructor to support the project's DI approach.

## Notes

The Storage Service is one of the foundational services in the system. It should be implemented early in the development process as other components will depend on it.
