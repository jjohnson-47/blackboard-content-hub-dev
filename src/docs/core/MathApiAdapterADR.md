# Architecture Decision Record: Math API Adapter Pattern

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The DevPreview UI needs to integrate with various mathematical visualization tools (such as Desmos, GeoGebra, etc.) to provide interactive educational content. Each of these tools has its own API with unique initialization, rendering, and state management approaches. We need a consistent way to interact with these different APIs while:

1. Maintaining a clean separation between our core application and the external APIs
2. Allowing for easy addition of new math visualization tools in the future
3. Providing a consistent interface for the rest of the application to use
4. Handling errors and edge cases specific to each math API
5. Managing the lifecycle of these tools within our application

## Decision

We will implement a Math API Adapter pattern with the following components:

1. **IMathApiAdapter Interface**: A common interface that all math API adapters must implement, providing a consistent way to interact with different math visualization tools.

2. **Concrete Adapter Implementations**: Specific implementations for each supported math API (e.g., DesmosAdapter, GeoGebraAdapter) that translate between our application's needs and the specific API's requirements.

3. **Factory System**: A factory pattern to create the appropriate adapter based on configuration or content type.

4. **Error Handling**: Specialized error handling for math API-specific issues, integrated with our central error handling system.

The adapter interface will include methods for:
- Initialization with configuration options
- Content updates
- State management (get/set)
- Cleanup/destruction

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Consistent Interface**: The rest of the application can interact with any math API through the same interface, simplifying integration.

2. **Isolation of Dependencies**: External API dependencies are isolated to their specific adapters, reducing the impact of API changes.

3. **Extensibility**: New math visualization tools can be added by implementing new adapters without changing the core application.

4. **Testability**: Adapters can be mocked for testing the rest of the application, and adapter implementations can be tested in isolation.

5. **Error Handling**: Specialized error handling for math API-specific issues improves reliability and user experience.

### Negative

1. **Additional Abstraction Layer**: Introduces an additional layer of abstraction, which may add some complexity.

2. **Potential Feature Limitations**: The common interface may not expose all features of each specific math API, potentially limiting advanced functionality.

3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Each adapter needs to be maintained and updated when the corresponding math API changes.

## Implementation Details

### IMathApiAdapter Interface

```typescript
export interface IMathApiAdapter {
  initialize(container: HTMLElement, options?: any): Promise<void>;
  updateContent(content: string): Promise<void>;
  getState(): any;
  setState(state: any): Promise<void>;
  destroy(): void;
}
```

### Adapter Factory

```typescript
export interface IMathApiAdapterFactory {
  createAdapter(type: string, options?: any): IMathApiAdapter;
  getSupportedTypes(): string[];
}
```

### Error Handling

Math API errors will be handled through the central error handling system with a specific error type:

```typescript
// In ErrorType enum
MATH_API = 'math-api'

// In ErrorHandler class
handleMathApiError(apiType: string, message: string, details?: any): void
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Direct Integration

Directly integrating each math API into the application would be simpler initially but would lead to tight coupling and make it difficult to add new tools or replace existing ones.

### Plugin System

A more complex plugin system could provide greater flexibility but would be overengineered for our current needs and would introduce unnecessary complexity.
