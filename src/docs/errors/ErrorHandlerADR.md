# Architecture Decision Record: Error Handler System

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The DevPreview UI application needs a consistent approach to error handling across all components and services. Errors can occur in various contexts:

1. During initialization of components
2. When communicating with external APIs
3. During storage operations
4. While validating user input
5. During runtime execution of code

Without a centralized error handling system, each component would need to implement its own error handling logic, leading to inconsistency, code duplication, and potential gaps in error reporting.

## Decision

We will implement a centralized Error Handler system with the following characteristics:

1. **Co-located Interface and Implementation**: Following our architectural pattern, the `IErrorHandler` interface and `ErrorHandler` implementation will be co-located in the `src/errors` directory.

2. **Standardized Error Types**: We will define an `ErrorType` enum to categorize errors (initialization, network, storage, validation, runtime).

3. **Custom Error Class**: We will create an `AppError` class that extends the standard `Error` class to include additional context like error type and details.

4. **Dependency Injection**: The Error Handler will be registered in the ServiceContainer and injected into components and services that need error handling.

5. **Consistent API**: The Error Handler will provide a simple, consistent API for handling errors, with methods like `handle()` and `createAndHandle()`.

6. **Extensible Design**: The implementation will include hooks for future enhancements like external error monitoring services.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Consistency**: All components will handle errors in a consistent manner.
2. **Centralized Logging**: Error logs will be centralized and formatted consistently.
3. **Improved Debugging**: Additional context (error type, details) will make debugging easier.
4. **User Experience**: User-facing error messages can be managed centrally.
5. **Extensibility**: The system can be extended to support additional features like error monitoring services.

### Negative

1. **Dependency**: Components and services will have an additional dependency on the Error Handler.
2. **Potential Overhead**: For very simple errors, using the Error Handler might introduce slight overhead compared to direct console logging.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Event-Based Error Handling

We considered implementing error handling through the EventBus, where components would emit error events that would be handled by a central listener. This approach would reduce direct dependencies but would make error handling less explicit and potentially harder to debug.

### 2. Context-Specific Error Handlers

We considered having specialized error handlers for different contexts (UI, network, storage). This would allow for more tailored error handling but would increase complexity and potentially lead to inconsistency.

### 3. Global Error Handler

We considered using a global error handler (e.g., window.onerror) for catching unhandled errors. While we may still implement this as a fallback, it doesn't provide the structured approach we need for handling expected errors in different contexts.

## Implementation Notes

The Error Handler should be one of the first components implemented as other components will depend on it. The implementation should be kept simple initially, focusing on core functionality (logging, error categorization), with more advanced features (error monitoring integration, rate limiting) added as needed.

## Related Decisions

- **Service Container Design**: The Error Handler will be registered in the Service Container.
- **Event System Design**: While not directly using the Event System for error handling, the Error Handler should be compatible with event-driven architecture.
- **Component Lifecycle Management**: Error handling during component initialization and cleanup should be considered.
