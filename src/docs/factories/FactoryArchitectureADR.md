# Architecture Decision Record: Component Factory Pattern

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The DevPreview UI project requires a flexible mechanism to create different types of components with various backend implementations. We need a consistent approach that supports dependency injection, allows for different implementations of the same component interface, and integrates with our existing systems.

The factory component needs to address several key challenges:

1. Supporting multiple math visualization backends (Desmos, GeoGebra, etc.)
2. Providing a consistent component creation process
3. Enabling runtime selection of appropriate implementation
4. Integrating with our service container, event bus, and error handling systems
5. Maintaining testability and clear dependencies

## Decision
We will implement a factory pattern with the following architecture:

1. A base `IComponentFactory<T, TConfig>` interface that defines the common contract for all factories
2. Specialized factory interfaces for each component type (IEditorFactory, IPreviewFactory, etc.)
3. A central `IFactoryRegistry` service that manages factory registration and retrieval
4. Abstract base factory classes that implement common functionality
5. Concrete factory implementations for each component type and backend

The factory architecture will follow these principles:

- **Factory Registration**: Factories register themselves with the registry, making them discoverable
- **Runtime Selection**: Components can be created based on configuration at runtime
- **Error Handling**: Integrated with the central error handling system
- **Event Publication**: Component lifecycle events published through the event bus
- **Self-Documentation**: Factories expose their component type and implementation ID

## Rationale

### Why a Factory Pattern?
The factory pattern provides several benefits for our architecture:

1. **Encapsulation**: Creation logic is separated from component usage
2. **Flexibility**: New implementations can be added without changing client code
3. **Configuration**: Complex initialization can be managed consistently
4. **Testability**: Components can be tested with mock factories
5. **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are injected and managed systematically

### Why a Registry?
The registry approach allows:

1. Runtime selection of appropriate factories
2. Discoverability of available implementations
3. A single point of access for factory management
4. Consistent error handling during factory operations
5. Self-documentation of available component implementations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of component creation from usage
- Support for multiple backend implementations (Desmos, GeoGebra, etc.)
- Consistent initialization approach across the application
- Better testability through factory mocking
- Simplified client code that doesn't need to know about specific implementations
- Self-documenting system of available factories

### Negative
- Additional abstraction layer may increase initial complexity
- Potential for factory proliferation if not managed carefully
- Need for consistent factory naming and identification conventions
- Slightly increased boilerplate for simple component creation

## Implementation Details

### Core Interfaces

The factory system will be based on these core interfaces:

```typescript
// Base component factory interface
interface IComponentFactory<T, TConfig = unknown> {
  create(config: TConfig, container: IServiceContainer): T;
  getComponentType(): string;
  getFactoryId(): string;
}

// Factory registry
interface IFactoryRegistry {
  registerFactory<T, TConfig>(factory: IComponentFactory<T, TConfig>): void;
  getFactory<T, TConfig>(componentType: string, factoryId: string): IComponentFactory<T, TConfig> | undefined;
  getFactoriesForType<T, TConfig>(componentType: string): Array<IComponentFactory<T, TConfig>>;
}

// Component-specific factory interfaces
interface IEditorFactory extends IComponentFactory<IEditor, EditorConfig> {
  // Editor-specific methods
}

interface IPreviewFactory extends IComponentFactory<IPreview, PreviewConfig> {
  // Preview-specific methods
}
```

### Event Integration

The factory system will emit lifecycle events through the event bus:

- `component:created` - When a component is successfully created
- `component:createFailed` - When component creation fails
- `factory:registered` - When a new factory is registered

### Error Handling

Factory operations will integrate with the error handling system:

```typescript
// Example error types
export enum ErrorType {
  // ... existing types ...
  FACTORY = 'factory',
}

// Factory-specific errors
try {
  // Factory operation
} catch (error) {
  errorHandler.handle(
    new AppError(
      ErrorType.FACTORY,
      'Failed to create component',
      { componentType, factoryId, config }
    )
  );
}
```
